class NDArithmeticMixin:
    """
    Mixin class to add arithmetic to an NDData object.

    When subclassing, be sure to list the superclasses in the correct order
    so that the subclass sees NDData as the main superclass. See
    `~astropy.nddata.NDDataArray` for an example.

    Notes
    -----
    This class only aims at covering the most common cases so there are certain
    restrictions on the saved attributes::

        - ``uncertainty`` : has to be something that has a `NDUncertainty`-like
          interface for uncertainty propagation
        - ``mask`` : has to be something that can be used by a bitwise ``or``
          operation.
        - ``wcs`` : has to implement a way of comparing with ``=`` to allow
          the operation.

    But there is a workaround that allows to disable handling a specific
    attribute and to simply set the results attribute to ``None`` or to
    copy the existing attribute (and neglecting the other).
    For example for uncertainties not representing an `NDUncertainty`-like
    interface you can alter the ``propagate_uncertainties`` parameter in
    :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`. ``None`` means that the result will have no
    uncertainty, ``False`` means it takes the uncertainty of the first operand
    (if this does not exist from the second operand) as the result's
    uncertainty. This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the
    different arithmetic operations.

    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics
    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like
    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m. So this Mixin has adopted
    this behavior.

    Examples
    --------
    Using this Mixin with `~astropy.nddata.NDData`:

        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, NDArithmeticMixin
        >>> class NDDataWithMath(NDArithmeticMixin, NDData):
        ...     pass

    Using it with one operand on an instance::

        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(100)
        >>> ndd.add(20)
        NDDataWithMath(120)

    Using it with two operand on an instance::

        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(-4)
        >>> ndd.divide(1, ndd)
        NDDataWithMath(-0.25)

    Using it as classmethod requires two operands::

        >>> NDDataWithMath.subtract(5, 4)
        NDDataWithMath(1)

        Base method which calculates the result of the arithmetic operation.

        This method determines the result of the arithmetic operation on the
        ``data`` including their units and then forwards to other methods
        to calculate the other properties for the result (like uncertainty).

        Parameters
        ----------
        operation : callable
            The operation that is performed on the `NDData`. Supported are
            `numpy.add`, `numpy.subtract`, `numpy.multiply` and
            `numpy.true_divide`.

        operand : same type (class) as self
            see :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`

        propagate_uncertainties : `bool` or ``None``, optional
            see :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`

        handle_mask : callable, ``'first_found'`` or ``None``, optional
            see :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`

        handle_meta : callable, ``'first_found'`` or ``None``, optional
            see :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`

        compare_wcs : callable, ``'first_found'`` or ``None``, optional
            see :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`

        uncertainty_correlation : ``Number`` or `~numpy.ndarray`, optional
            see :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`

        operation_ignores_mask : bool, optional
            When True, masked values will be excluded from operations;
            otherwise the operation will be performed on all values,
            including masked ones.

        axis : int or tuple of ints, optional
            axis or axes over which to perform collapse operations like min, max, sum or mean.

        kwargs :
            Any other parameter that should be passed to the
            different :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` (or wcs, ...)
            methods.

        Returns
        -------
        result : ndarray or `~astropy.units.Quantity`
            The resulting data as array (in case both operands were without
            unit) or as quantity if at least one had a unit.

        kwargs : `dict`
            The kwargs should contain all the other attributes (besides data
            and unit) needed to create a new instance for the result. Creating
            the new instance is up to the calling method, for example
            :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`.

        Parameters
        ----------

        operand : `NDData`-like instance

        -------
        result_data : ndarray or `~astropy.units.Quantity`
            If both operands had no unit the resulting data is a simple numpy
            array, but if any of the operands had a unit the return is a
            Quantity.

        There is actually no calculation involved but it is a good place to
