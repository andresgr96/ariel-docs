def resolve_name(name: str, *additional_parts: str) -> object:
    """Resolve a name like ``module.object`` to an object and return it.

    This ends up working like ``from module import object`` but is easier
    to deal with than the `__import__` builtin and supports digging into
    submodules.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : `str`
        A dotted path to a Python object--that is, the name of a function,
        class, or other object in a module with the full path to that module,
        including parent modules, separated by dots.  Also known as the fully
        qualified name of the object.

    additional_parts : iterable, optional
        If more than one positional arguments are given, those arguments are
        automatically dotted together with ``name``.

    Raises
    ------
    `ImportError`
        If the module or named object is not found.
    """
def minversion(module: ModuleType | str, version: str, inclusive: bool = True) -> bool:
    """
    Returns `True` if the specified Python module satisfies a minimum version
    requirement, and `False` if not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    module : module or `str`
        An imported module of which to check the version, or the name of
        that module (in which case an import of that module is attempted--
        if this fails `False` is returned).

    version : `str`
        The version as a string that this module must have at a minimum (e.g.
        ``'0.12'``).

    inclusive : `bool`
        The specified version meets the requirement inclusively (i.e. ``>=``)
        as opposed to strictly greater than (default: `True`).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import astropy
    >>> minversion(astropy, '0.4.4')
    True
    """
def find_current_module(depth: int = 1, finddiff: bool | list[Literal[True] | str | ModuleType] = False) -> ModuleType | None:
    """
    Determines the module/package from which this function is called.

    This function has two modes, determined by the ``finddiff`` option. it
    will either simply go the requested number of frames up the call
    stack (if ``finddiff`` is False), or it will go up the call stack until
    it reaches a module that is *not* in a specified set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    depth : int
        Specifies how far back to go in the call stack (0-indexed, so that
        passing in 0 gives back `astropy.utils.misc`).
    finddiff : bool or list
        If False, the returned ``mod`` will just be ``depth`` frames up from
        the current frame. Otherwise, the function will start at a frame
        ``depth`` up from current, and continue up the call stack to the
        first module that is *different* from those in the provided list.
        In this case, ``finddiff`` can be a list of modules or modules
        names. Alternatively, it can be True, which will use the module
        ``depth`` call stack frames up as the module the returned module
        most be different from.

    Returns
    -------
    mod : module or None
        The module object or None if the package cannot be found. The name of
        the module is available as the ``__name__`` attribute of the returned
        object (if it isn't None).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``finddiff`` is a list with an invalid entry.

    Examples
    --------
    The examples below assume that there are two modules in a package named
    ``pkg``. ``mod1.py``::

        def find1():
            from astropy.utils import find_current_module
            print find_current_module(1).__name__
        def find2():
            from astropy.utils import find_current_module
            cmod = find_current_module(2)
            if cmod is None:
                print 'None'
            else:
                print cmod.__name__
        def find_diff():
            from astropy.utils import find_current_module
            print find_current_module(0,True).__name__

    ``mod2.py``::

        def find():
            from .mod1 import find2
            find2()

    With these modules in place, the following occurs::

        >>> from pkg import mod1, mod2
        >>> from astropy.utils import find_current_module
        >>> mod1.find1()
        pkg.mod1
        >>> mod1.find2()
        None
        >>> mod2.find()
        pkg.mod2
        >>> find_current_module(0)
        <module 'astropy.utils.misc' from 'astropy/utils/misc.py'>
        >>> mod1.find_diff()
        pkg.mod1

    """
def isinstancemethod(cls, obj):
    """
    Returns `True` if the given object is an instance method of the class
    it is defined on (as opposed to a `staticmethod` or a `classmethod`).

    This requires both the class the object is a member of as well as the
    object itself in order to make this determination.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : `type`
        The class on which this method was defined.
    obj : `object`
        A member of the provided class (the membership is not checked directly,
        but this function will always return `False` if the given object is not
        a member of the given class).
